# MAPS_ResidualDatasets
The residual datasets can be used for multipath analysis and processing in the MAPS.
All the residual files should be decompressed. Then, the DDRES should be put into the folder '..\MAPS\0_Input\1_MHMSFmodel\0_ddres\'; the UDIFRES should be put into the folder '..\MAPS\0_Input\1_MHMSFmodel\1_udifres\'; the UDUCRES should be put into the folder '..\MAPS\0_Input\1_MHMSFmodel\1_uducres\'.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
